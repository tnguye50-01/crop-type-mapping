Master's Thesis: Crop Type Mapping in Natore, BangladeshThis repository contains the Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts, documentation, and (eventually) final report for my Master's thesis: "Crop type mapping in Natore district, Bangladesh, using temporal-spatial crop information and remote sensing data."Project GoalThe objective of this research is to develop and validate a methodology for accurate crop type classification in Natore District using Sentinel-2 time-series data. The primary method involves creating monthly temporal composites and applying a Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine.Key Files in This Repositorygee_crop_mapping.js: The primary Google Earth Engine script for data preprocessing, classification, and accuracy assessment.thesis_progress_tracker.html: A web-based task tracker (uses Firebase for persistence) to manage project milestones.README.md: This file./data/ (Coming Soon): This directory will hold the Natore AOI shapefile and any ground truth data (e.g., .geojson, .csv)./report/ (Coming Soon): This directory will contain drafts and the final manuscript of the thesis.Technologies UsedPlatform: Google Earth Engine (GEE)Satellite: Sentinel-2Classifier: Random Forest (RF)Language: JavaScript (for GEE)Tools: Git, GitHubProject Roadmap & Task ListThis checklist tracks the main tasks from project inception to final defense.Phase 1: Project Setup & Literature Review[ ] Finalize Research Questions: Refine the exact questions the thesis will answer.[ ] Define Scope: Confirm the study period (e.g., "Jan 2023 - Dec 2023") and specific crop types.[ ] Conduct Comprehensive Literature Review:[ ] Search for papers on "crop mapping Bangladesh," "Sentinel-2 time series," "GEE Random Forest," etc.[ ] Summarize existing methods and identify research gaps.[ ] Document common challenges (e.g., cloud cover, similar crop signatures).[ ] Write Thesis Proposal: Draft and get approval from advisor.[ ] Set up GEE Account & Git Repo: Initialize project environment.Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Preprocessing[ ] Acquire Study Area Boundary (AOI): Find/create a precise shapefile/GeoJSON for Natore District.[ ] Acquire Ground Truth Data:[ ] Collect field data points (GPS coordinates) for each class (Boro, Wheat, Jute, Water, Urban, etc.).[ ] If field data is impossible, find reliable secondary sources.[ ] Digitize data into a Feature Collection (e.g., in GEE or as a shapefile).[ ] Define Image Collection (GEE):[ ] Select Sentinel-2 SR Harmonized.[ ] Filter by AOI and date range.[ ] Develop Preprocessing Workflow (GEE Script):[ ] Implement cloud/shadow masking.[ ] Implement NDVI/EVI calculation.[ ] Crucial: Ensure system:time_start property is preserved in all mapped functions.Phase 3: Methodology & Implementation (GEE Script)[ ] Create Temporal Composites:[ ] Generate monthly (or 15-day) median composites.[ ] Stack all composites into a single, multi-band image (temporal stack).[ ] Prepare Training Data:[ ] Import ground truth FeatureCollection into GEE.[ ] Add a numeric class property.[ ] Split data into trainingSet (70%) and validationSet (30%).[ ] Train Classifier:[ ] Sample the temporal stack using trainingSet.[ ] Initialize and train a Random Forest (RF) classifier.[ ] Classify Image:[ ] Apply the trained classifier to the temporal stack.[ ] Clip the final classified map to the Natore AOI.Phase 4: Analysis, Validation & Results[ ] Perform Accuracy Assessment:[ ] Classify the validationSet.[ ] Generate an Error Matrix (.errorMatrix()).[ ] Document Overall Accuracy, Kappa, Producer's, and Consumer's Accuracy.[ ] Analyze Results:[ ] Interpret the confusion matrix (e.g., "Wheat was often confused with...").[ ] Analyze temporal-spatial patterns based on known crop calendars.[ ] Export Final Products:[ ] Export the final classified crop map as a GeoTIFF.[ ] Export accuracy assessment tables.[ ] Refine Classification (if needed):[ ] Iterate on training data, feature bands, or classifier parameters if accuracy is low.Phase 5: Thesis Writing & Defense[ ] Write Introduction: (Use proposal and literature review).[ ] Write Study Area & Data Chapter: Describe Natore, GEE, Sentinel-2, and ground truth data.[ ] Write Methodology Chapter: Detail every step of your GEE script and analysis.[ ] Write Results & Discussion Chapter: Present maps, tables, and interpret what they mean. Discuss limitations.[ ] Write Conclusion: Summarize findings, answer research questions, and suggest future work.[ ] Draft, Revise, & Format: Assemble all chapters, abstract, references, etc.[ ] Submit to Advisor: Get feedback and revise.[ ] Prepare Defense Presentation: Create slides summarizing your work.[ ] Defend Thesis!
